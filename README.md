# smartlaser
A robot that points to the correct answer of a math word problem showed by a camera. The Computer Vision module will detect a paper hold by a person and will convert the frame to text using Optical Character Recognition. The text, including a math problem and four diffrent possible answers, will be sent to the Natural Language Processing module, which will translate the math word problem to a mathematical equation. This equation will then be solved and the result will be sent to the Robotics module that consists of a simulation of a laser pointer that will point to the correct answer out of the four.
